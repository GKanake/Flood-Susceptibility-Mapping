<p>This project demonstrates the application of geospatial techniques, that is Remote sensing and Geographical
    information
    systems in flood susceptibility mapping in Tana Delta Sub County Area of Study. Tana Delta is chosen as the area of
    study as the region has experienced annual flood events with flood events reported in Floods reports by Relief web
    demonstrating that floods are perennial in the region being recorded in 1997/1998 El Nino, May 2003,2006, 2008,
    March
    2010, 2011, 2012 flash floods, 2013 March to May, November 2015 to January 2016, 2018 referred to as Mini El Nino,
    2019,
    May 2020 and May 2021.
    <br>
    <br>
    The flood events not only cause harm to property and infrastructure but are a threat to human and
    animal life in the region. Flood conditioning factors of elevation, slope, annual rainfall, river density, distance
    to
    rivers, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, land use, and soil drainage are identified. Corresponding thematic
    layers of the conditioning factors are produced, reclassified, and evaluated using the Frequency Ratio model in
    ArcMap
    for eventual classification according to their contributing effect to flooding in five classes of very low, low,
    moderate, high, and very high susceptibility.
    <br>
    <br>A final map layout was prepared to show five classes of susceptibility;
    very low susceptibility (36.16%), low susceptibility (23.27%), moderate susceptibility (21.51%) high susceptibility
    (9.58%), and very high susceptibility (9.48%). It is however worth noting that most settlements are along River
    Tana, for which these areas along river tana were most susceptible to flooding adding to the
    fact that the area receives high conventional rainfall and is also at a very low flat elevation. However, as
    elevation
    rises to the west of the sub-county susceptibility level is reduced. Accuracy assessment carried out on the dataset
    revealed an Overall Accuracy (OA) of 70%.</p>
